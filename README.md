# kindle_to_csv_anki
This Python script automatically exports vocal builder lookups from Kindle into a CSV file that you can easily import into Anki. It's perfect if you would like to do sentence mining with your kindle. It uses the DeepL API and the Python DeepTranslator library to automatically fetch translations of both the word in question and the entire sentence. It also automatically bolds the word in the context sentence to make it more readable.

You need to sign up for a free API Key from DeepL to use the script. You can also change the source/target languages if you want. The default is Spanish > English.
